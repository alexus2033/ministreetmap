Many free GPS apps collect extensive personal data such as location, movement profiles, and browsing history in the background, often without transparent disclosure. This data is frequently used for advertising or analytics. Many apps request unnecessary permissions, which allows extensive user profiles to be created.

Instead of an app, this project uses an HTML file that is copied to a mobile device.
If you open this file with a modern browser, comprehensive GPS information is also available:
- Street map/satellite map with zoom
- Comprehensive location search
- Display of gas stations, supermarkets, restaurants, etc. (POIs)
- All services and APIs are open source -> No Google-Services, no tracking
