# ministreetmap
Instead of an app, this project uses an HTML file that is copied to a mobile device.
If you open this file with a modern browser, comprehensive GPS information is also available:
- Street map/satellite map with zoom
- Comprehensive location search
- Display of gas stations, supermarkets, restaurants, etc. (POIs)
- All services and APIs are open source -> No Google(!)
